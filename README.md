#	Grav Setup
## This is a basic set of instructions to set up the grav CMS in a minimal voidlinux installation

1. Install voidlinux as usual. Perform a network style installation to get the most minimal system possible.
2. make sure you are connected to the internet.
3. copy the content of setup.sh
4. run it from a reasonable place (i.e. /root, ~ ) as root/ via sudo (need to install packages)

As always, don't use scripts blindly.
No one but you is responsible in case if anything bad happens to anyone or anything.
Mod the code as you like, contribution is welcomed.
