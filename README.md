# Grav Setup
## This is a basic set of instructions to set up the grav CMS in a minimal voidlinux installation

1. Install Voidlinux as usual. Perform a network style installation to get the most minimal system possible. (or just use your existing system)
2. cd into a reasonable place (i.e. /root, ~ )
3. as root/sudo, run: ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Piraty/gravSetup/master/setup.sh > setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh```

DISCLAIMER:
As always, don't use scripts blindly.
No one but YOU is responsible in case anything bad happens to anyone or anything.
Modify the code as you like, contribution is welcomed.
